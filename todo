Make handling of css with css-query-selectors possible... maybe a table 'css_body' that has a collection of rules, then css_selectors that have i.e.

	.breadcrumbs>ul li

the css_body can have id, text varchar, selector_id (to css_selectors.id).

Those will be printed in the <style> area of render.php
